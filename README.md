# CTDC-Human-Trafficking-Data
Dataset. Go! analysis of human trafficking data from https://www.ctdatacollaborative.org/download-global-dataset.

Dataset. Go! is my publication on Medium.  The idea is to take an open source dataset and see what can be done in 60 minutes.  For this project, I made bar graphs and a decision tree.
